Personal take on the [cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com)

Used as a learning opportunity for both Go and Cryptography in general. 

Keep in mind that most of these challenges are coded with a happy path scenario in mind.
There is very little error handling and most of the code is designed around the conditions 
and the input provided by the challenges. This helps to keep the code concise and readable.
